# Overview

The aim of this unit is to provide you with the skills and knowledge necessary to design and develop software for embedded systems that must interact in a real-time manner with an environment of sensors and actuators.

# Labs

Complete a set of 6 laboratory exercises that require you to develop software and demonstrate outcomes to the tutor in class. You also complete short answer questions during the labs that test your individual understanding of the theory and programming tools. Each test is about 15 minutes in duration. A test is conducted every 4 weeks. The best 2 of 3 scores are retained.

# Project

You are required to design and develop the software for an embedded system to control an external device. You will work in groups and are required to make individual oral presentations and submit a group written report.
